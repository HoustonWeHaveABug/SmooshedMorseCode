Kid, don't point the gun at my head! If you have the guts, shoot me!!
Kit, you're right. We live in separate worlds. Your world is a better place...I may have taken the wrong path, but I am willing to make things right again, for it is not too late.
That's enough!!! I don't need your pity!!...You don't owe me anything! I would never force my own friends to do something they wouldn't do! I have my own regulations! I just don't want to live like this anymore!!...Do you think I like to beg!?...I've been in bad shape for three years, waiting for this opportunity! This is my only chance, not to prove that I'm the best, but to simply take back what I have lost!!!...Look at yourself. Look at what you've become!!...Back then, people rejected you! Now you can't even take two steps without someone following you!!! Have you ever fought for a chance? You never have. Never!!!...I don't want to be like you...
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?!?
Uh-oh! Towel! I need a towel!
I heard that, you twig!
"Waiter, I'm in my soup!"
But I am flying! And from way up here, you all look like little ants!
First rule of leadership: everything is your fault.
Francis, leave them alone. They are poo-poo heads.
I know it's a rock! Don't you think I know a rock when I see a rock? I've spent a lot of time around rocks!
I hate performing on an empty stomach!
I swear, if I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!
I think I'm going to wet myself.
I'm finished! Finally I'm a beautiful butterfly.
I'm the only stick with eyeballs!
It was all a part of the plan!
It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, princess. One of those "circle of life" kind of things.
Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzing around a dung heap all day!
Let this be a lesson to all you ants: ideas are very dangerous things. You are mindless, soil-shoving losers put on this earth to serve us!
"Hey, bartender! Bloody Mary, O-positive."
No...it's because I'm a PROP! You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick! A splinter!
Shoo, fly, don't bother me.
So! Being a ladybug automatically makes me a girl! Is that it, fly boy? Huh?!
Someday, I will be a beautiful butterfly, and then everything will be better.
That's our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life!
"Okay, who ordered the poo-poo platter?!"
What's the point of going out there? They'll only laugh at me...
Why didn't I think of that? Oh, because it's suicide!
You let one ant stand up to us, and they all might stand up! Those "puny little ants" outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out... THERE GOES OUR WAY OF LIFE! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING BACK! Does anyone else wanna stay?
You piece of dirt. No, I'm wrong. You're lower than dirt. You're an ant!
You're wrong...Hopper. Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers. I've seen these ants do great things, and year after year, they somehow manage to pick enough food for themselves and you! So-so who's the weaker species?! Ants don't serve grasshoppers! It's you who need us! We're a lot stronger than you say we are. And you know it, don't you?
Ok, i just wanna say What's up? Grandma, grandpa... and ... to the other two old people...What's up? ... yeah, you two.
"Like... we see a picture of this young lady. But to the lady, are we just a picture of us? Did you ever think about that?"
Can you believe we actually had sex with these asswads?
Richard Grieco, you see right through me.
Did you grab my ass? Do you want to?
Nobody gets in unless they talk to the list. We're on the list. Name? Steve and Doug Butabi. You're brothers? No...? YES. Man, works every time. That's very funny. Yea, Doug's hilarious.
There you are. We got scared. Of who, we'll kick his ass. No we got scared someone stole you away from us. Oh... oh, like some other girls would steal us away. Oh...OH.
So hey, let me ask you something. How long have we been friends? All seven years of high-school. Yeah, at least. That's why I gotta be real with you right now. As a professional trainer, guys, I'm a little worried about your triceps. i mean you guys are going all the week out and it's called full extention. And i'm not seeing it. Craig, you're right. We actually had a long talk about that the other night. Looong taaalk. I just don't want you guys to cheat on yourselves. And i'm sorry to come down here like this but ... pfff ... in a weird way it's my job. Hey, that's why we love you and we hate you. So, still friends? You know it! I'm glad we had this talk.
So... you want to dance? We're not in the club yet. Right.
About the store? You sit around thinking about the store? You're supposed to be thinking about ... Hey what's up? You want some of this? Or a little of that?
Is that a mirror in your pocket? What? 'Cause I can see myself in your pants!
So anyways, I was standing there waiting to use the pay phone. Yeah, he was, seriously. And this guy who was on the phone, turns around and tips his hat like this. And who do you think that guy was? Emilio Estevez. The Mighty Duck man, I swear to God, I was there. Of course you were, you were the one who yelled the Breakfast Clubber's name. I was like, "Emilio."
Why go out for burgers when you have steak at home? You're right, we should go out for lunch after this.
You can take our phones and you can take our keys, but you cannot take away our dreams. Yeah, because we're, like, sleeping when we have them.
What I do understand is that you're going to a big new hot club tonight. Is that what it is? That's right. Exactly. What I don't understand is how you're gonna get there. What are you doing? God. Man.
Dooey, did you just grab my ass? Sir, from where I'm standing, that's a physical impossibilty. Oh, I know your tricks, Dooey!
Wait a minute, did you just grab my ass? No. Do you want to? No... should I?
Mr. Zadir, Dooey just called from Pismo Beach. He says there's no way he could've grabbed your ass. What is he up to now?
Dad, is there any way I can get out of this? Yes... nooooooo.
I miss Doug! He's in the guest house! He's 20 feet away! But he doesn't have cable! Yes he does! He has Cinemax! But there's no HBO! GOD!
Oh my god, Doug. This is the most amazing place I've ever been. Guys, guys. This is the coat room. The club's in here.
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Steve, slow down. I can't help it man, it's hottie overload. Just pace yourself. Ok... What's up?... 2, 3, 4. What's up?... 2, 3, 4...
What's up? Do you know you were doing 50? Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls over just anybody? Make a move. What's up? Just giving you an $80 ticket. She is so into you. I want you to do me a favor. What ever you say, "T.J. Hooker". Please obey all posted speed limits. Have a good night. It's already been good, now that you have served and protected me. Way to go brother! You got her badge number and you got a date to meet her at the Municipal State Court. Up top. Very nice! Yeah!
Good, how are you? About 8 o'clock, 8:15. Yeah, all the time. BMW. Right at sunset. Vanilla mostly.
How long will they last? Well, they'll last forever, cause they're silk. They'll always be there. They'll never die. They'll never change. They'll never say you're not good looking. They'll always be in your room where you left them and not suddenly move out to the guest house.
Are you seeing planes? Is your name Tattoo? Because swear to God, you're living on Fantasy Island. - man, that was a sweet show - Yeah, it was a sweet show.
Hey, Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket? Because I can see myself in your pants.
Hey, nice bulbs, Emily. Oh, and I don't mean that metaphorically.
Hi. You've reached Doug Butabi. I'm not here right now because I'm too busy outside living it up, unlike my pussy-whipped brother who's too busy throwing his life away for Emily. Beep.
Man, I owe you BIG TIME! For bringing me here!
So... you guys wanna make out or what?
You know what i heard when i first met you? - No. - Beeew, Beeew, Beeew, Beeew. - What are you doing? - That's an ambulance, come and take me away, 'cos the sight of you stopped my heart.
You know, just because you and your brother are having problems, doesn't mean you have to refer to my intellectual capacity in a dimunitive manner.
One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better lock your door. Five, six, grab your crucifix. Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. Nine, ten, never sleep again.
Oh man. Midnight. Baseball bats and bogeymen. Beautiful.
"Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personnel Devices"? What're you reading it for? I'm into survival.
What did you do to your arm? I burned it in English class.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? No. They got a whole system they call "dream skills". So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? Yeah. Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills. And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears. What happens if they don't do that? I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
What are dreams, anyway? Mysteries. Incredible body hocus-pocus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. What happened? That needle sank like a rock. She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now. Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
You didn't sleep, did you? The doctor says you have to sleep or you'll-- Go even crazier? I don't think you're going crazy, and stop drinking that damn coffee.
You want to know who Fred Krueger was? He was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew. It drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it. But it was even worse when they caught him. What happened? Well, the lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that. So a bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room. We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then let it burn. He's dead, Nan. He can't get you. Mommy killed him.
His name is even in it, written right in here: Fred Krueger. Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mom? You better tell me, cause now he's after me! Nancy, trust your mother for once. You'll feel better as soon as you sleep. Feel better?! You call this feeling better?! Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you. Avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded. Fred Krueger can't be after you, Nancy. He's dead! Fred Krueger is dead. Dead and gone. Believe me, I know. Now go to bed. I order you, go to bed. You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up! You're sick, Nancy. Imagining things. You need to sleep, it's as simple as that. Screw sleep! Nancy! Nancy!It's only a nightmare! That's enough!
What'd he look like? You get a look at him? No. Well then how can you say somebody else was there? Because somebody cut her. While I watched. Somebody cut her while you watched and you don't know what he looked like? I couldn't see the ****er. You could just see the cuts happening, all at once. I probably could've saved her if I'd moved sooner. But I thought it was just another nightmare, like the one I had the night before. There was this guy who had knives for fingers.
I don't see why you couldn't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming. Everyone's got to dream. If you don't dream, you go...
Glen, you bastard. What'd I do? I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me. Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream. And what did you do, you shit? You fell asleep.
I know you're there, Krueger. You think you was gonna get away from me? I know you too well now, Freddy. And now you die. It's too late, Krueger. I know the secret now. This is just a dream, too. You're not alive. The whole thing is a dream. I want my mother and friends again. You what? I take back every bit of energy I ever gave you. You're nothing. You're shit.
The killer's still loose, you know. You saying somebody else killed Tina? Who? I don't know who he is. But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and green sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knifes he's got made into a sort of glove. Like giant finger-nails.
You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen? No. You believe in the bogeyman? No. Rod killed Tina, and you know it.
Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina. Had your name written all over it. There's four letters in my name, Rod. How could there be room on your joint for four letters? Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower! Nyahh. Rod says the sweetest things. He's nuts about you. Yeah, nuts.
I knew there was something about you I liked. You feel better now, right? Jungle man fix Jane. No more fights? No more fights. Good. No more nightmares for either of us then. When did you have a nightmare? Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the market or something.
All day long I've been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails... Fingernails? That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night. What'd you dream? I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and green sweater. But what about the fingernails? He scraped his fingernails along things. Actually, they were more like finger-knives or something, like he'd made them himself. Anyway, they made this horrible noise. Nancy. You dreamed about the same creep I did, Nancy. That's impossible.
Please God... This... is God.
She dreamed this would happen. She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her last night. That's why we were there, Mom. She was afraid to sleep alone.
Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court.
Come out and show yourself, you bastard.
Hey, can't catch me!
I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me. Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream. And what did you do, you shit? You fell asleep.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
His name is even in it, written right in here! Fred Krueger. Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mom? You better tell me, cause now he's after me!
Come to Freddy.
Gonna get you.
I'm gonna kill you slow.
I'm gonna split you in two.
I'm here.
I'm into survival.
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.
Tina, watch this.
You stupid bitch, you're killing...you're killing us!
This is where he takes us.
Freddy's home.
I killed you once before, you son of a bitch!
Do you like my body?
Hi. Welcome to the snake pit.
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.
In my dreams I'm beautiful. And bad!
Sleep, those little slices of death, how I loathe them.
In my dreams I can stand. My legs are strong. In my dreams I am the Wizard Master.
I'm not going to take any more of this. How much longer are you going to go on blaming your dreams for your own weaknesses? Lady, how much longer you gonna keep blowing smoke up our ass?! That's enough, Kincaid! There will be no repeat occurrences of last night's events. From now on your doors will be locked during sleeping hours. We'll start a policy of evening sedation for everybody. The **** you will! Anybody tries drugs on me gets his ass kicked! Well, you just bought yourself a night in the quiet room, Mister. Now sit down! **** you! You sit down!
You! Oh, my God. Run!
Joey, look. All the little piggies come home. Let him go, Krueger! Your wish is my command.
This is it, Jennifer. Your big break in TV. Welcome to prime time, bitch!
I said, where's the ****ing bourbon?! You should listen to your mother. Goddamn it, Kristen, you ruin everything! Every time I bring a man home you spoil it! You know what your shrink says? You're just trying to get a little attention!
Will, you look tired. Have a seat. No thanks. I'm fine just the way I am. For now, maybe. But when you wake up, it's back... in the saddle... again.
Taryn...Taryn! What? Why, uh...why should we fight? We're old friends, you and I. Remember? Let's get high.
He's turning us against each other so we will be weak. Bullshit. No, she's right.
The man in my dreams, he's real, isn't he? He's real.
Five, six, grab a crucifix. Seven, eight, better stay up late. Nine, ten, never... never... Never sleep again. Where did you learn that rhyme?
Girl, what are you doing? Watching TV. I can see that. Why don't you read a book? You watch too much damn TV. Research. Oh, you gonna be a big TV star. Wait and see. Yeah, well if Simms catches you here after lights out, she's gonna chew my ass off. I gotta stay up, Max! Jennifer... I can't handle the nightmare. Not after Phillip. All right, but I never saw you. Thanks, Max.
This slump over here, this is Kincaid. Now I want you to take a good look. See, he gets himself thrown in the quiet room so often that you probably won't see a whole lot of him. Ain't that right, cool breeze? Right. I do it so I don't have to look at your ugly face all the time. Yeah, I love you too.
I know who's trying to kill you. Save it lady. We're not in the mood. He wears a dark brown hat. He has razors on his right hand. His skin is badly burned. Wh-who is he? His name is Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer when he was alive. After he died, he became something much, much worse. Six years ago, he killed my friends. He almost killed me. And now he's back. But why is he after us? Yeah, what did we do? It's not you. It's your parents, my parents. They burned him alive, and now we're paying for their sins. You are the last of the Elm Street children. Mom and Dad? That's crazy, they never mentioned anything like that. Oh yeah, that's just the kind of thing your parents want to let you know. "Good night darling, say your prayers. Oh by the way your dad and I just torched some maniac last night".
I used to live in this house. That's just a house I dream about.
He's strong; he's never been this strong. The souls of the children give me strength.
Only one thing can save the children now. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest... Neil? What are you doing up here? Oh, I was just talking to... To who?
In the name of Lowrek, Prince of Elves, demon begone! Aah! Sorry, kid. I don't believe in fairy tales.
I'm in. Me, too. Let's go kick the mother****er's ass all over Dreamland. Yeah!
Can I ask you a question? Why certainly. Who gives a **** what you think?!
Welcome home, Taryn. Look familiar? Okay, asshole, let's dance!
Yo, Freddy! Where you hiding at, you burnt-faced pussy?! You think your hot shit with the little mute kid, don't ya? Well, let me see you come get a piece of me! Krueger, pussy! Yeah, I knew he was a little chicken.
Ain't gonna dream no more, no more. Ain't gonna dream no more. All night long I sing this song. Ain't gonna dream no more.
Great, now my dick's killin' me.
He couldn't hack it, so he got nailed. Period.
It's now or never. I'm not gonna kid you, this is as dangerous as it gets. If you die in this dream it's for real. Nobody has to go in that doesn't want to.
Let's snuff the sucka.
Phillip, wake up... Have a nice stroll, asshole.
Welcome to Prime Time, bitch!
What a rush!
What's wrong, Joey? Getting tongue tied?
You're mine now, piggy.
And I knew just as surely, just as clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last.
As a Presbyterian, my father believed that man by nature was a damn mess. And that only by picking up God's rhythms, were we able to regain power and beauty. To him, all good things, trout as well as eternal salvation come by Grace. And Grace comes by art. And art does not come easy.
As time passes, my father struggled for more to hold on to, asking me again and again: had I told him everything. And I finally said to him, "maybe all I know about Paul is that he was a fine fisherman." "You know more than that," my father said; "he was beautiful." And that was the last time we spoke of my brother's death.
Dear Jessie, As the moon lingers a moment over the Bitterroot's, before its descent into the invisible, my mind is filled with song. I find I am humming, softly, not to the music, but to something else, some place else. A place remembered. A field of grass where no one seemed to have been, except the deer, and the memory is strengthened by the feeling of you, dancing in my awkward arms. Norman.
In my family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing. We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in Missoula, Montana. Where Indians still appeared out of the wilderness to walk the honky tonks and brothels of Front Street.
It is those we live and love should know who elude us.
Like many fly fishermen in Western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being of my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.
Long ago, when I was a young man, my father said to me... "Norman, you like to write stories?" And I said, "Yes, I do." Then he said, "Someday, when you're ready... you might tell our family story. Only then will you understand what happened and why."
The Burns family ran a general store in a one store town and still managed to badly. They were Methodist, a denomination my father always referred to as Baptist who could read.
They're both marvelous. I'd say Lord has blessed us all today... It's just that he has been particularly good to me.
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar: Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home. Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind; In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; In the faith that looks through death, Thanks to the human heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
Is there anything else you can tell me? Nearly all the bones in his hand were broken. Which hand? His right hand.
My candle burns at both ends; it will not last the night. But ah my foes, and oh my friends - it gives a lovely light.
If he came back next summer, would you try and help him? If you wanted me to. Well he's not coming back. Well, at least he's got friends out there. Who Ronald Coleman? Why is it the people who need the most help... won't take it? I don't know Jess. Well, I don't cry Norman. Can I show you something? Only if it's something good. Read. So, what do you think? What do I think? I think it's the berries! You do? Yeah, to get away, Chicago, God it's haven. Have you ever been? No, not anywhere. Helena. Congratulations Norman! Truth is, I'm not sure about I want to leave. Montana? Why? It'll always be here. Not Montana. Then what? What! I'm not sure I want to leave you.
I'm not leavin'. What? These hands are hot, Norm. I can feel it. What are you talking about? You can't go back in there. Norman, it's fine. I'll be fine. But they won't even let you play. Oh, yes they will. With what? Your own debt up to your God damned neck. Norm, it's my debt. OK, it's my debt. Jesus Christ.
Oh, I'll never leave Montana, brother.
You're late, Neal. Yeah, yeah, I didn't get in until late. Well, I didn't get in at all but I was here. Neal, Paul. Paul, Neal. We've met. Neal, in Montana, there's three things we're never late for: church, work, and fishing. Couldn't you find him? The hell with him. Well, I thought you were supposed to help him. How the hell do you help that son of a bitch? By taking him fishing. He doesn't like fishing. He doesn't like Montana and he sure as hell doesn't like me. Well, maybe what he likes is somebody trying to help him. I'm in deep trouble. Yep. Want me to come over and protect you? Hello, Jess. Hey, Paul. How's your brother? You both left him alone. Well, I'm sorry about that. That was my fault. Well, you're not forgiven. Was Norman forgiven? Norman's not funny.
Would you be so kind and shut down my pain receivers?
He who is without "sim", cast the first stone.
Those were the years when the icecaps melted due to the greenhouse gases and the oceans had risen and drowned so many cities along all the shorelines of the world. Amsterdam, Venice, New York forever lost. Millions of people were displaced. Climate became chaotic. Hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries. Elsewhere a high degree of prosperity survived when most governments in the developed world introduced legal sanctions to license pregnancies. Which was why robots, who were never hungry and did not consume resources beyond those of their first manufacture were so essential an economic link in the chain mail society.
I am not a toy!
Now we run!
Mommy? Will you die? Well, one day, David, yes, I will. I'll be alone. Don't worry yourself so. How long will you live? For ages. For 50 years. I love you, Mommy. I hope you never die. Never.
What's for dinner tonight? You know you don't eat. Yes. But I like sitting at the table.
It occurs to me with all this animus existing against Mechas today it isn't just a question of creating a robot that can love. Isn't the real conundrum, can you get a human to love them back? Ours will be a perfect child caught in a freezeframe. Always loving, never ill, never changing. With all the childless couples yearning in vain for a license our Mecha will not only open up a new market but fill a great human need. But you haven't answered my question. If a robot could genuinely love a person what responsibility does that person hold toward that Mecha in return? It's a moral question, isn't it? The oldest one of all. But in the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love him?
Are you in trouble? Have you run away from someone? My mother told me to run away. Why did she say that? I guess because Henry didn't like me. Why was that? Martin came home. After I find the Blue Fairy then I can go home. Mommy will love a real boy. The Blue Fairy will make me into one. Is Blue Fairy Mecha, Orga, man or woman? Woman. Woman? I know women! They sometimes ask for me by name. I know all about women. About as much as there is to know. No two are ever alike, And after they've met me, no two are ever the same. And I know where most of them can be found. Where? Rouge City. Across the Delaware. Too far for our feet. We'll need help to get there. And it's not without peril. We will have to journey towards the moon. Are there many women in Rouge City? As there are stars at night. How do we find just one? We will ask Dr. Know. There is nothing he doesn't. Exactly what name do you give this woman? She is just Blue Fairy. Blue Fairy. In the world of Orga, blue is the color of melancholy. Yet the services I provide will put a blush back on anyone's cheek. I will change the color of your fairy for you. She will scream out: "Oh, yes! Oh, God! Oh, yes! Oh, God! Oh, God!". She will make you a real boy for I will make her a real woman and all will be right with the world because you held my hand and saved my brain so that once again my customers my ask for me by name: "Gigolo Joe, whaddaya know?".
Miss Bevins, it's Joe, at your service. I've been counting the seconds since last we met. Have you been crying, Samantha? I found a tear. Hey Joe, what do you know? How many seconds has it been since the last time you two were together? 255,133. Goodbye, Sam, and never forget: you killed me first. I'm in bad trouble.
You won't understand the reasons but I have to leave you here. Is it a game? No. When will you come back for me? I'm not, David. You'll have to be here by yourself. Alone? With Teddy. No. No, no, no! No, Mommy, please! No, no. Please, Mommy. They would destroy you, David! I'm sorry I broke myself. I'm so sorry I cut your hair off. I'm sorry I hurt Martin. I have to go. I have to go! Stop it! I have to go now. Mommy, don't! Mommy, if Pinocchio became real and I become a real boy can I come home? That's just a story. But a story tells what happens. Stories are not real! You're not real! Now, look. Take this, alright? Don't let anyone see how much it is. Look. Don't go that way. Go anywhere but that way or they'll catch you. Don't ever let them catch you! Listen, stay away from Flesh Fairs, away from where there are lots of people. Stay away from all people. Only others like you, only Mecha are safe! Why do you want to leave me? Why? I'm sorry I'm not real. If you let me, I'll be so real for you! Let go, David! Let go! I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world.
I'm afraid. Of me? Yes. That I will hurt you? Yes. I think... you're afraid of letting go. I think you're afraid of happiness. And this is starting to excite me. Are you afraid of seeing the stars, Patricia? I can show you how to reach them. I'm afraid of what you've got under there. May I see what it looks like first? Is this your first time... with something like me? I've never been with Mecha. That makes two of us. I'm afraid it will hurt. Patricia... once you've had a lover-robot you'll never want a real man again. Are these the wounds of passion? Do you hear that music? You... are a goddess, Patricia. You wind me up inside. But you deserve so much better in your life. You deserve... me.
Gigolo Joe, whaddaya know?
I do love you, you know. I have always loved you.
Come away O human child/ To the waters and the wild/ With a fairy hand in hand/ For the world's more full of weeping/ Than you can understand.
I am... I was.
I can never go to sleep... but I can lay quietly and not make a peep.
I can't accept this! There is no substitute for your own child!
I like your floor.
I never had a birthday.
In this day and age, David, nothing costs more than information.
Many a mecha has gone to the end of the world... never to come back! That is why they call the end of the world "MAN-hattan".
Mommy... I'm sorry I broke myself.
My brain is falling out.
My mommy doesn't hate me! Because I'm special! And unique! Because there's never been anyone like me before, ever! Mommy loves Martin because he is real, and when I am real Mommy's going to read to me and tuck me in my bed and sing to me and listen to what I say and she will cuddle with me and tell me every day a hundred times a day that she loves me!
My son was one of a kind. You're the first of a kind.
Please make me a real boy.
She loves what you do for her, as my customers love what it is I do for them. But she does not love you David, she cannot love you. You are neither flesh, nor blood. You are not a dog, a cat, or a canary. You were designed and built specific, like the rest of us. And you are alone now only because they tired of you, or replaced you with a younger model, or were displeased with something you said, or broke. They made us too smart, too quick, and too many. We are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes, all that will be left is us. That's why they hate us, and that is why you must stay here, with me.
Starving minds, welcome to Dr. Know! Where fast food for thought is served up 24 hours a day, in 40, 000 locations nationwide. Ask. Dr. Know - there's nothing I don't.
The greatest single human gift - the ability to chase down our dreams.
There are girls your age that are just like me. We are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being. You won't get us pregnant or have us to supper with mommy and daddy. We work under you, we work on you and we work for you. Man made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible.
They hate us, you know... The humans. They'll stop at nothing.
When you become a real boy, remember me to the ladies when you grow up.
You are a real boy. At least as real as I've ever made one.
"Relatively soon, I will die. Maybe in 20 years, maybe tomorrow, it doesn't matter. Once I am dead and everyone who knew me dies too, it will be as though I never existed. What difference has my life made to anyone. None that I can think of. None at all."
"There was a time that I wouldve asked why"
Oh no, look who's with them. It's Queen Bitch of the Universe.
60 knots, no wave lines; the Reds don't have anything that fast.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. Everything is.
Linds, I want you to stay away from that guy. I mean it. The guy is gone. Did you see his hands? What? He's got the shakes? Look, he's operating on his own. He's cut off from his chain of command, he's showing signs of pressure-induced psychosis and he's got a nuclear weapon. So as a personal favor to me, will you try to put your tongue in neutral for a while?
So these guys are SEALs, huh? Eh, those guys ain't so tough. I fought guys plenty tougher'n them. So, is this where you tell us how you "coulda been a contender"?
What is all this stuff? Fluid breathing system. We just got them. You use it when you go really deep. How deep? Deep. How deep? It's classified.
You know, we got Russian subs creepin' around here; somethin' goes wrong they can say whatever they want happened. Relax, will ya? You're makin' the women nervous. Cute, Virgil.
Bud, how much oxygen you've left? About 5 minutes. Bud, if you drop all your ballast you can still make it... Gonna stay for a while... I knew this was a one-way trip.
Explorer, this is Cab 3, starting the descent along the umbilical. Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck. Luck is not a factor.
Hi, Brigman. Hi, Mrs. Brigman.
I had over four years invested in this project. Yeah, you only had three years invested in me. Well you have to have priorities.
There is something down there. Something not us. You could be more... specific. Something that zigs- Not us! Not human. Get it? Something non-human, but intelligent. A non-terrestrial intelligence. A non-terrestrial intelligence! NTIs. Oh man, that's better than UFOs! Oh, but that works too, huh? "Underwater Flying Objects".
You know, you got some huevos bringin' that thing into my rig! With all that's going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon IN HERE?! Mrs. Brigman... Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me? Mrs. Brigman, you don't need to know the details of our operation. It's better if you don't. You're right! I don't need to know! What I need to know is that thing is off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?!
This tells us how much radiation we're getting? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I ain't going near no radiation. No way. Aw, Hippy, you pussy. Well what good's the money six months later your dick drops off?
God, I hate that bitch. Probably shouldn't've married her, then, huh?
Bud, you know your hand is blue? Finler, why don't you just shut up put your gear on?
So, I can hear you, but I can't talk, right? The fluid prevents the larynx from making sound. It'll feel a little strange. Yeah, no shit.
Well, it's official, sports fans. They're calling it Hurricane Fredrick, and it's going to make our lives real interesting in a few hours. Fred, huh? I don't know,man, I think hurricanes should be named after women, don't you?
Hell, for triple time, I'd eat up Beany! Set me on fire and put me out with horse piss.
These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.
Touchdown. Crowd goes wild.
See this? They used to call this "The Hammer".
Goddamn, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in your life! Now fight! Fight! Fight!
LOVE YOU WIFE.
Everybody just stay calm. The situation is under control.
Heeeeeeeeeeere's M.I.R.V.!
Huh. Damn rat's breathing that shit. That is no bullshit, hands down, the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.
I got to tell you, I give this whole thing a sphincter-factor of about 9.5.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you. Oh, Bud you're not alone. You remember that time, you were pretty drunk, you probably don't remember... but the power went out at the old apartment, the one on Orange Street... and we were staring at that one little candle, and I said something really dumb like that candle is me, like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life... and you just lit up another candle and put it beside mine and said "No, see? That's me. That's me..." And we stared at the two candles, and then we... well, if you remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the next part. Bud, there are two candles in the dark. I'm with you. I'll always be with you, Bud, I promise that.
It went straight for the warhead, and they think it's cute.
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline, years of training... A lot of people don't appreciate that.
Keep your pantyhose on.
Schoenick, your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move.
Sniff something? Well did ya, rat boy?
So raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water-tentacle.
This here's a bottomless pit, baby. Two and a half miles, straight down.
Triple-time sounded like a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.
Virgil, you wiener.
We all see what we want to see. Coffey looks and he sees Russians. He sees hate and fear. You have to look with better eyes than that.
We don't need them. We can't trust them. We may have to take steps. We're gonna have to take steps.
When it comes to the safety of these people, there's me and then there's God, understand?
When you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving your arms around.
